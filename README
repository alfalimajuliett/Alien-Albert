Alien Albert Visits the United States of America
Created by Mary Pattison

This is an educational computer game designed to teach U.S.A. geography,
specificaly, the states and their capitals. It was built using Visual Basic
in Visual Studio Express for Desktop 2012.

In this game, the user is an alien named Albert who is invading the U.S.A.
Albert will randomly move from state to state and will ask the user to enter the
capitals (with correct spelling) to complete the mission. Each capital that is 
answered correctly awards the user one point. 
High scores can be saved using the 'Save Score' button. This saves the scores
as a .txt file in the 'bin' folder of the project folder, under 'Debug'.

The user can choose from three missions: 10 states, 25 states, 50 states.
When all the states in the mission have been completed, the user's score will 
be shown. The score can be checked at any time during the game with the 
'Show Score' button.

This program took about 30 hours to develop. It incorporates animation, randomization, 
loops, If statements, Try statements, Arrays, structures and more. I believe it utilizes
many of the things I have learned so far.
